### üß© Contribute Your Own Levels!

Want to make your own challenge for **Processing Battle**? Awesome! You can contribute a new level by submitting your solution through GitHub. If it fits the spirit of the game, it may be added to the official game!

#### üõ†Ô∏è How to Create a Custom Level

1. **Go to the `solutions/` folder**  
   Create a new file following this format:  
   `Solution_[your_name]_[level_number].pde`
   Example: `Solution_Alex_05.pde`

2. **Write your solution inside a function** with the same name as the file (without the `.pde` extension)  
   Example:  
   ```java
   void Solution_Alex_05() {  
     // your image-replicating code here  
   }
   ```

3. **Update the main `Solution.pde` file**  
   This file controls which solution is displayed.  
   Add your function call there.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   Solution_Alex_05();
   ```

4. **Test your challenge**  
   Make sure your level:  
   - Runs without errors  
   - Displays cleanly in the interface  
   - Is visually interesting or fun to replicate

#### üöÄ Submit Your Level

Once your level is ready:

1. Fork this repository on GitHub  
2. Add your custom level files and update `Solution.pde`  
3. Commit and push the changes to your fork  
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to this repository

**In the PR description, include:**
- A short title and description of the challenge  
- Your name or handle (for credit!)  
- (Optional) What inspired your design

If your level fits the game's style, it‚Äôll be merged into the official version!
